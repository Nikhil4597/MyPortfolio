                <p>Sometimes, it helps if a pick-up line is catchy and has a nice ring to it. Going off of the famous "roses are red, violets are blue," poem, Youtuber Jimmy Zhang made his own pick-up line with several references to Naruto: "Sharingan is red, Rasengan is blue, give me your number or I'll Chidori you."

                    Rasengan and Sharingan are the signature techniques of Naruto and Sasuke, while the Chidori threat could be in reference to Rin's death via Kakashi's Chidori. Of course, you should never really threaten to "Chidori" someone in order to get their number, but the pick-up line was definitely catchy.</p>
